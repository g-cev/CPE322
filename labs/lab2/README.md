# Lab 2: Command Line

### Procedure

Below are the commands that were provided for this lab. Since I am not using a Linux machine, there will be an alternate version underneath containing the equivalent commands for Windows. The main differences are:
```
$ man uname -> $ uname --help
$ ifconfig -> $ ipconfig
```

Linux Commands:
```
$ hostname
$ env
$ ps
$ pwd
$ git clone https://github.com/kevinwlu/iot.git
$ cd iot
$ ls
$ cd
$ df
$ mkdir demo
$ cd demo
$ nano file
$ cat file
$ cp file file1
$ mv file file2
$ rm file2
$ clear
$ man uname
$ uname -a
$ ifconfig
$ ping localhost
$ netstat

```

Windows Commands:
```
$ hostname
$ env
$ ps
$ pwd
$ git clone https://github.com/kevinwlu/iot.git
$ cd iot
$ ls
$ cd
$ df
$ mkdir demo
$ cd demo
$ nano file
$ cat file
$ cp file file1
$ mv file file2
$ rm file2
$ clear
$ uname --help
$ uname -a
$ ipconfig
$ ping localhost
$ netstat

```

### Results

The following results will include the terminal command used, a screenshot of any available visual results, and a short description of what it does.

# ```$ hostname```

![hostname command](../lab2/assets/hostname.PNG)

This command is used to display the host name portion of the full computer name of the computer. 

# ```$ env```

![env command](../lab2/assets/env.PNG)

This command lists all of the environment variables.

# ```$ ps```

![ps command](../lab2/assets/ps.PNG)

This command allows the user to check the status of active processes on a system.

# ```$ pwd```

![pwd command](../lab2/assets/pwd.PNG)

This command writes to standard output the full path name of your current direction (from the root directory).

# Git cloning, Changing Directories, and Listing Files

```
$ git clone https://github.com/kevinwlu/iot.git
$ cd iot
$ ls 
$ cd
```

![git cd and ls command](../lab2/assets/cd_ls.PNG)

The "git clone" command clones the contents of the GitHub repository onto your system. 
The "cd" command means "change directory". It will change the directory to the next place in a path written after it.
The "ls" command lists the files of the current directory.

#```df```

![df command](../lab2/assets/df.PNG)

This command is used to view the amount of free diskspace on a server.

#```df```

![df command](../lab2/assets/df.PNG)

This command is used to view the amount of free diskspace on a server.



![cat file command](../lab2/assets/cat_file.PNG)


## What I Learned

This lab taught me about Nano, a simple terminal-based text editor, along with several terminal commands that can manipulate file directories. Before this assignment, I did not realize that Windows-equivalent Linux commands existed. I am planning on uploading my GitHub repository to my personal files and practice commands for tasks that I would usually execute in the browser.
