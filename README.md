## Background
My interest in computers and coding began in sophomore year of high school, where one of the art classes taught us how to use JavaScript to code shapes into drawings.

I toured my school's Computer Science program, but ended up feeling drawn towards Computer Engineering once I saw the cool robots the engineer students were making. Once I got in, I made my own, too!

Besides computer engineering, my other interests include:
- My cat, Corvin
- Baking pies
- Really good chicken parmesean
